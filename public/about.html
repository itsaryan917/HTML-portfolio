<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> As an undergraduate student at the National Institute of Technology Patna (NITP), I find myself at a pivotal juncture in my academic journey. 
  While the core curriculum provides a solid foundation, I am eager to explore beyond textbooks and classroom lectures.
   My hunger for knowledge extends beyond the prescribed syllabus, driving me to seek out new skills and experiences.</p>

<p>NITP offers a vibrant campus life, and I actively participate in various clubs, workshops, and events.
   Whether itâ€™s coding competitions, robotics challenges, or literary debates, I immerse myself in diverse activities.
    My curiosity knows no boundsâ€”I attend guest lectures, hackathons, and seminars, always eager to learn from experts in different fields.
   From programming languages to graphic design, I believe that versatility is the key to personal growth.</p>

<p>While academics remain my priority, I allocate time for passion projects. 
   Whether itâ€™s learning a new programming language, mastering a musical instrument, or experimenting with photography, 
  I thrive on the thrill of acquiring fresh skills. NITPâ€™s supportive environment encourages this pursuit, 
  and I am grateful for the opportunities that shape me into a well-rounded individual.
   As I continue my journey, I look forward to honing my abilities, connecting with like-minded peers,
    and contributing meaningfully to the world beyond the classroom walls. ðŸŒŸ</p>
